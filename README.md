# GIC3001

An remake of my old project GIC3000

Everthing started ass a highschool project. Me and my friend was trying to make a small LED-display,
that could be controlled from a computer. We called it GIC2000. We failed to get it to work, but we
where close. A few years later I resumed the project and got it to work. The project was named GIC3000.
Unfortunatly I lost the sourcecode in a harddrive crash. But I later remade a working version of it.

This is that version. It uses a ATMEGA8535 microcontroller. The program is simpler than the one for GIC3000
and is written in assembler. There's also an test-client written in python.
